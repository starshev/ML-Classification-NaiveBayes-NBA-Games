# ML with Python · Naive Bayes Classifier · NBA Games

**Context**

The task is to help NBA managers and coaches identify which players are most likely to thrive in the high-pressure environment of professional basketball and help the team be successful over time. To do this, a subset of data needs to be analyzed, that contains information about NBA players and their performance records.  
  
The first step is to conduct feature engineering to determine which features will most effectively predict whether a player's NBA career will last at least 5 years. The insights gained will be then used in building the predictive Naive Bayes Classification machine learning model.
